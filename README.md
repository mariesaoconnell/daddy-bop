# daddy-bop

Daddy Bop was created to replace the discord server's Baby Bop, created when @Ryan Johnson was learning how to create discord bops. With inspiration from my husband and little bit of research, I decided to use Discord.js and DisTube to replace Baby Bop with Daddy Bop!

## How to use Daddy Bop?

1. Download the Zip File and open within your preferred IDE
2. You'll need to create a .env file in the 'musicbot' root folder
> ### .env file setps:
  > The .env is going to hold your Token, Server ID, and Client ID. To obtain your bot token you'll need to go to discord.com/developers, create your bop and copy the token. For the Server ID, you'll right click your server and copy Server ID and once you've invited your bot to your server, you'll do the same for your bot by right clicking it for it's id.

  With this information, you'll paste it in your .env file like so:
  ```
  TOKEN = <TOKEN from DISCORD BOT>
  CLIENT_ID = <THIS IS YOUR BOT'S ID>
  GUILD_ID = <THIS IS YOUR SERVER ID>
  ```

3. CD into MusicBot and type the command 'nodemon' to host your bot.


If you find yourself having issues with setting up your bot and inviting it to your server, I recommend reviewing the following docs:
